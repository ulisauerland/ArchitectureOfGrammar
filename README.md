## Description of Blockseminar: The architecture of grammar

Architectural considerations played a big role in linguistic research in the 1970s (e.g. work by Chomsky, Jackendoff, and Montague), but less since.  The goal of the seminar is to develop a critical understanding of both the classical arguments and more recent work bearing on the matter.  We introduce a rough division between syntax-based, usage-based, and meaning-based conceptions of grammar, but focus on concrete empirical arguments that can distinguish between these.
