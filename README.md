## Description of Blockseminar: The architecture of grammar

Architectural considerations played a big role in linguistic research in the 1970s (e.g. work by Chomsky, Jackendoff, and Montague), but less since.  The goal of the seminar is to develop a critical understanding of both the classical arguments and more recent work bearing on the matter.  We introduce a rough division between syntax-based, usage-based, and meaning-based conceptions of grammar, but focus on concrete empirical arguments that can distinguish between these.

The architecture of grammar
March 20 to 24, 2023, every day 9:30 to about 13:30

MSc Linguistics, MM2, MM3, MM7

written take-home exam on Friday, due within one week
### second class

Current research on the structure of grammar
March 20 to 24, 2023, officially every day 9:30 to 16:30 

The LeibnizDream project at ZAS develops a novel view of the architecture of grammar.  The primary source of evidence used is date from many different child languages we collect together with 50 collaborators all over the globe. The project targets six central areas of syntactic and semantic research.  In this seminar, advanced students can discuss with researchers of ZAS to develop a research paper in the area of the course.  This seminar is only open to students attending also the ~~"The Syntax-Semantics Interface"~~ "The Architecture of Grammar" course.

additional written take-home exam on Friday, due within one week
